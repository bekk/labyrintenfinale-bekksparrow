# Running and Building the App

To run the app locally:

1. If you haven't already, install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app from the project root:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   - **Do not run commands in the `backend` directory.** The project is set up to handle both frontend and backend automatically from the root.

3. The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](mdc:http:/localhost:3000).

4. The backend runs on port 8080, but you do **not** need to access it directly. All backend API routes are proxied and accessible from the frontend on port 3000, under the `/api` subroute (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/tips`).

# Deployment

To deploy the app:

- Simply push to the `main` branch.
- The app will be automatically deployed to [https://bekksparrow-9ffe029a038a.herokuapp.com](mdc:https:/bekksparrow-9ffe029a038a.herokuapp.com)
